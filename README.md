# Dovahkiin-Desktop-Status
This Conky theme brings the status bars and aesthetic of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim to your Linux desktop. It displays key system information in a visually appealing and thematic way, including CPU usage (Health), GPU usage (Magicka), and RAM usage (Stamina), using reversed bars to mimic the in-game draining effect.
